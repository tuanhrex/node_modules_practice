# Node Modules Practice

- [x] Fork and clone this repo
- [x] Initialize node in your cloned repo so it becomes a node project!

## Make your own module

- [x] Create a node module that stores an array of your favorite foods
- [x] Import that module into your `index.js`
- [x] Write code in your `index.js` so when you run your app, it loops through the array, printing all of your favorite foods to the console

## Experiment with implementing a package

- [x] Find 3 [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages that look interesting
- [x] Experiment with incorporating them into this node project, just like we did with moment

## Add to your Node app instructions readme

- [x] Add notes about how to create and import node modules to your Node/Express app readme, along with instructions about adding a `.gitignore`
- [x] Paste the link to your repo in this the readme of this assignment
- https://github.com/tuanhrex/node-express

## Finally, .gitignore and submit a PR!

- [x] Add a `.gitignore` to this assignment, so the `node_modules` folder doesn't upload to Github
- [x] Submit this assignment by making a `pull request`
